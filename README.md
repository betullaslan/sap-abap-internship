# SAP ABAP Internship Projects

This repository includes a variety of simple to intermediate ABAP reports and utility programs developed during my 2025 internship.  
The projects aim to strengthen basic ABAP skills through hands-on practice with commonly used programming structures, such as loops, conditions, parameters, and output formatting.

These exercises are suitable for beginners and early-stage learners looking to build a solid foundation in SAP ABAP development.

## Tasks Overview

### `task1_number_checks.abap`  
Analyzes numbers from 0 to 100 by classifying them as even or odd and counting each type.  
Also lists numbers divisible by 2, 3, and 5, and checks where a user-input value falls within specific numeric ranges.

### `task2_calculator_fm.abap`  
Implements a basic calculator using **Function Modules** in ABAP.  
Supports arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) with modular structure and user input handling.

### `task2_calculator_perform.abap`  
A simple calculator program built using **FORM routines (`PERFORM`)** to organize arithmetic operations in a structured and reusable way.

### `task2_calculator_screen.abap`  
Presents a basic **interactive screen (dynpro)** for the calculator using `SE51`.  
Includes input/output fields for numbers and operations, showcasing screen-based user interaction in ABAP.

### `task3_alv_order_list.abap`  
Generates a structured **ALV (ABAP List Viewer)** report displaying a list of customer orders.  
Demonstrates usage of ALV functions to sort, filter, and format tabular data dynamically.

## Notes

All programs in this repository were developed for learning purposes during an internship period.  
They demonstrate basic to intermediate ABAP logic and are intended for practice, experimentation, and educational use within a test or sandbox environment.
